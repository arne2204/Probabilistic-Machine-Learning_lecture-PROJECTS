I suggest that in addition to the features that you correctly identified as irrelevant, you also remove columns such as track_album_id, and other properties that are not music-related. Perhaps even the name of the track is not needed, although it would be interesting to see if metrics such as the lenght of the title or the number of words in it have any correlation with the popularity of the track, just for fun."
