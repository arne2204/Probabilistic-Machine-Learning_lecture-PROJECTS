I uploaded my current working notebooks and results to the folder. 
Several notebooks have been added and results will be presented in today's lecture (July 7th).

So far I have:
  1. Created labels for the story using an LLM with sevaral  configurations
  2. Processed my results structure
  3. Explored the Neural Data, with GMM, PCA and CEBRA (contrastive learning model)
  4. Results are stored inside the notebooks, and some are stored inside the results folder.
  5. The neural data is not uploaded due to the large file size - same for the models.

My next steps will be to analyze any correlation between the semantic data and the neural data to try to identify any meaningful patterns, for this I will attempt to map the semantic embeddings and the neural embedding into the same space.
