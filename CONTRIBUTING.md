# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for participating in this course!

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Probabilistic-Machine-Learning_lecture-PROJECTS.git
```

3. Navigate to `projects/` and create your folder (if it does not exist already):

```bash
mkdir projects/your_project-id
```

4. Add your work under that folder.
5. Commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "meaningful message to help keeping track of the modifications/additions"
git push origin main
```

6. Go to your fork on GitHub and click New Pull Request.

## Good Practices

- Do not modify files outside your own folder.
- Push regular small commits.
- Write clear commit messages.
- Use consistent file naming (no spaces; use `_` instead).
- Keep your requirements.txt file updated
- Add your progress in the report file frequently

## File Structure Example

```
projects/your_project-id/
├── report/
├── notebooks/
├── scripts/
├── data/
├── results/
├── misc/
├── README.md
```

## Important

All pull requests will be reviewed before being merged. Violations of the guidelines may cause delays in acceptance.
